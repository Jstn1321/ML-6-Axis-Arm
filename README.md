## The Build Process

### The Idea

I initially wanted to create an arm that could pick up objects (like the in the pictures below) and identify what the ojects were and place their own seperate boxes.


But this turned out to not only being not very hard but also not being very fun! It took me an extremley short amount of time to create and train the machine learning model,as seen below, to sort the cubes so the plan now for the robot arm is to train a robot arm that can perform simple and effortless surgeries on patients.

### Mechanical Design

I started with the mechanical design at first because it was defininatly my weakest skill. Starting with absolutly no previous knowledge with CAD was tough and solidworks is not very good for beginners, but fortunatly solidworks has some built in tutorials. The first few iterations of my designs did not include the most important thing I learned from my mechanical design journey, ***ball bearings***.
